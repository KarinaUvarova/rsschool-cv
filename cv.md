### Profile
Computer science has been my favorite subject since high school. At the university, I enjoyed writing my first codes, but I studied at the Faculty of Economics and computer science was not enough for me there. Programming has remained an unfulfilled dream. Working as an economist, I tried to automate everything I could. At the same time, in partnership with my husband, I took up photography and became an advanced user of Adobe Photoshop. Recently we had a small business - a delivery restaurant, and I was setting up the site and I really liked it. Now I have moved to another country, there are new opportunities and I am studying what I thought about from an early age.
